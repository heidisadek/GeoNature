# GeoNature

GeoNature is a Geographic Information System (GIS) application developed in C++ for the course ECE297: Software Design and Communication. While the main focus is mapping areas and offering other tools for navigation, it was also designed with the theme of biodiversity in mind. 

## Features
### Direction Finding
GeoNature allows a user to find the shortest path using the A* algorithm from one point to another. The user may choose to type their directions, or simply click on the map to input their desired source and destination.
